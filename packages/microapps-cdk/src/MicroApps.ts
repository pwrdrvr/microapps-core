   * Typically any admin roles / users that need to view or manage the S3 Bucket
   * would be added to this list.
   *
   * Roles / users that are used directly, not assumed, can be added to `s3PolicyBypassRoleNames` instead.
   *
   * Note: This AROA must be specified to prevent this policy from locking
   * out non-root sessions that have assumed the admin role.
   *
   * The notPrincipals will only match the role name exactly and will not match
   * any session that has assumed the role since notPrincipals does not allow
   * wildcard matches and does not do wildcard matches implicitly either.
   *
   * The AROA must be used because there are only 3 Principal variables available:
   *  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_variables.html#principaltable
   *  aws:username, aws:userid, aws:PrincipalTag
   *
   * For an assumed role, aws:username is blank, aws:userid is:
   *  [unique id AKA AROA for Role]:[session name]
   *
   * Table of unique ID prefixes such as AROA:
   *  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-prefixes
   *
   * The name of the role is simply not available for an assumed role and, if it was,
   * a complicated comparison would be requierd to prevent exclusion
   * of applying the Deny Rule to roles from other accounts.
   *
   * To get the AROA with the AWS CLI:
   *   aws iam get-role --role-name ROLE-NAME
   *   aws iam get-user -â€“user-name USER-NAME
   *
