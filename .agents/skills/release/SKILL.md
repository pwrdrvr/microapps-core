description: "Plan and publish a GitHub Release in this repo's tag-driven workflow. Use when a user asks to cut, prepare, or publish a software release, propose the next vX.Y.Z tag, support prerelease tags like vX.Y.Z-beta.N, draft better release notes from PRs and direct commits since the last release, update CHANGELOG.md, create the tag pinned to an exact commit, and watch `.github/workflows/release.yml` publish the repo's npm packages."

# Release

Use this skill for `microapps-core`, which publishes from GitHub Releases and wants human-written notes instead of GitHub's generated summary.

## Guardrails

- Prefer the repo's default branch from `gh repo view`; do not guess.
- Start from a clean working tree. If tracked files are dirty, stop and ask before continuing.
- If the current branch is not the default branch, stop and ask before switching.
- Fetch before planning: `git fetch origin --tags`.
- Fast-forward the default branch before editing: `git pull --ff-only origin <default-branch>`.
- Never force-push the default branch.
- Never use GitHub generated release notes for this workflow.
- Always create the release tag with a leading `v`, for example `v0.6.0` or `v0.6.0-beta.1`.
- Always pin the release to the exact changelog commit SHA with `gh release create --target <sha>`.
- If `origin/<default-branch>` moves after planning or before pushing, stop and regenerate the release plan.
- If the tag is a prerelease such as `v0.6.0-beta.1`, the GitHub release must be created as a prerelease too.
- This repo's release workflow publishes stable tags to npm `latest` and prerelease channels like `beta` to the matching npm dist-tag, so do not publish a `-beta.N` tag as a normal GitHub release.

## Repo Notes

- The release workflow to watch is `.github/workflows/release.yml` with the name `Release Packages`.
- `packages/microapps-cdk` is still `projen`/`jsii` managed and the root release workflow handles its publish packaging separately from the other npm packages.
- The root release workflow also publishes `pwrdrvr`, `@pwrdrvr/microapps-publish`, `@pwrdrvr/microapps-datalib`, and `@pwrdrvr/microapps-router-lib`.
- Store temporary planner and notes artifacts under `.local/release/`. The repo ignores `.local/`.

## Helper Script

Use the bundled planner to gather release facts and raw note inputs:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/release/scripts/release_plan.py --output-dir .local/release
```

If the user wants a beta or other prerelease, ask the planner for a prerelease suggestion too:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/release/scripts/release_plan.py --output-dir .local/release --prerelease-channel beta
```

It writes:

- `.local/release/release-plan.json`
- `.local/release/release-plan.md`

The planner:

- finds the latest published semver release
- counts first-parent commits on the default branch since that release
- filters leaked release-housekeeping commits such as changelog-only commits
- proposes the next tag
- groups PR-backed changes separately from direct commits on `main`
- captures contributor mentions for PR-backed items

The planner suggests the next stable tag. If the user wants a beta release, rerun it with `--prerelease-channel beta` so it also suggests the next `<stable-tag>-beta.N`.

## Approval Prompt

Before making any changelog edit, commit, push, tag, or release, show the user:

- the last release tag
- the raw and meaningful commit counts since that release
- the suggested new tag and why
- whether the change looks like a minor release or a small emergency patch
- the exact commit SHA currently at `origin/<default-branch>`
- whether this should ship as a stable release or a prerelease such as `beta`

If the meaningful commit count is less than `3`, explicitly warn that there are not many changes in this release and ask whether they still want to proceed.

## Notes And Changelog Rules

- Do not copy PR titles verbatim into release notes.
- Rewrite each PR-backed item into a clearer user-facing bullet.
- For direct commits on `main` with no PR, use the commit subject and body as raw input and rewrite those too.
- Add the PR author mention on the same line for PR-backed entries.
- Keep the same substance in `CHANGELOG.md` and the GitHub release notes.
- Prefer grouped sections such as `Highlights`, `Fixes`, `Performance`, `Docs`, and `Internal` when they fit the release.
- If `CHANGELOG.md` does not exist, create it with a `# Changelog` header.
- Insert the new release section at the top, directly under the file header if there is one.
- Use a heading in this shape:

```md
## v0.6.0 - 2026-03-12
```

- If you make a dedicated changelog commit, use a subject like:

```bash
docs: add changelog for v0.6.0
```

## Versioning Heuristic

Use the planner's suggestion unless the user overrides it.

- Default to a minor bump: `v0.5.0` -> `v0.6.0`.
- Use a patch bump only for a small hotfix shortly after the previous release.
- Treat `v0.9.0` -> `v0.10.0` as the normal next minor bump.
- Do not jump from `v0.9.0` to `v1.0.0` unless the user explicitly asks.
- For a beta release, start from the planner's suggested stable target and use `-beta.N`.
- If there is no existing beta for that target, start at `-beta.1`.
- If betas already exist for that target, use the planner's prerelease suggestion so you increment the highest existing beta number before creating the GitHub prerelease.

The bundled planner treats a patch release as the default only when all of these are true:

- the last release is recent
- there are only a few meaningful commits
- the included changes are patch-sized fix/docs/ci/chore/deps style work
- there is no obvious feature or larger performance/restructure change

## Execution Flow

1. Prepare the repo.

```bash
git fetch origin --tags
default_branch=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name')
current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)
test "$current_branch" = "$default_branch"
git pull --ff-only origin "$default_branch"
python3 .agents/skills/release/scripts/release_plan.py --output-dir .local/release
```

2. Read `.local/release/release-plan.md` and summarize the proposed release for approval.

If this is a prerelease, run the planner with `--prerelease-channel beta` before summarizing so the approval prompt includes the exact prerelease tag.

3. After approval, write:

- `.local/release/release-notes.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

4. Commit and push the changelog commit on top of the planned branch tip.

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "docs: add changelog for <tag>"
git push origin HEAD:"$default_branch"
release_sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

5. Create the release from that exact commit.

Stable release:

```bash
gh release create "<tag>" \
  --target "$release_sha" \
  --title "<tag>" \
  --notes-file .local/release/release-notes.md
```

Prerelease:

```bash
gh release create "<tag>" \
  --prerelease \
  --target "$release_sha" \
  --title "<tag>" \
  --notes-file .local/release/release-notes.md
```

If the repo prefers a titled release name such as `<tag> - short theme`, use that instead of the plain tag.

6. Verify the release and watch the publish workflow.

```bash
gh release view "<tag>"
run_id=$(gh run list --workflow release.yml --event release --limit 10 --json databaseId,headSha,status,conclusion \
  --jq '.[] | select(.headSha == "'"$release_sha"'") | .databaseId' | head -n1)
gh run watch "$run_id"
```

If the publish workflow fails, inspect it yourself:

```bash
gh run view "$run_id" --log-failed
```

## Best Practices

- Re-read the generated notes before publishing; fix awkward wording instead of shipping raw commit text.
- Keep release bullets user-facing and outcome-oriented, not implementation-jargon heavy.
- Mention direct-to-main commits that would otherwise be invisible to GitHub's PR-based notes.
- If the approval gap was long, rerun the planner immediately before editing `CHANGELOG.md`.
- If the push to the default branch is rejected, stop and regenerate notes from the new branch tip instead of rebasing blindly.
